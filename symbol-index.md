## Some basic rules

- For most functions, they are identified by uppercase letters.
- Tuples are generally identified by capital letters
- A scalar or fixed-size array of bytes is identified by a lowercase letter. For example, n represents the nonce of the transaction, and there may be some exceptions, such as δ representing the amount of stack data required for a given instruction.
- Variable-length byte arrays generally use bold lowercase letters. For example, **o** represents the output data of a message call. It is also possible to use bold uppercase letters for some important things.
