The source code of eth includes the following packages.

- The downloader is mainly used to synchronize with the network, including the traditional synchronization method and fast synchronization method.
- Fetcher is mainly used for block-based notification synchronization. When we receive the NewBlockHashesMsg message, we only receive a lot of block hash values. The hash value needs to be used to synchronize the block.
- Filter provides RPC-based filtering, including real-time data synchronization (PendingTx), and historical log filtering (Log filter)
- Gasprice offers price advice for gas, based on the gasprice of the last few blocks, to get the current price of gasprice
