P2p source code and several packages below

- Discover contains the[Kademlia protocol](./references/Kademlia.pdf). It is a UDP-based p2p node discovery protocol.
- Discv5: new node discovery protocol. Still a test proposal. This analysis is not covered.
- Part of the code for nat network address translation
- Netutil: some tools
- Simulations simulation of p2p networks. This analysis is not covered.
