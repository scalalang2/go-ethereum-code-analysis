## Usage

The paper comes as a single ``latex`` file ``Paper.tex``. The latest version is generally available as a PDF at https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf. If you find that the borders for links block too much text when viewing the PDF in the browser, you can instead download it and open and view it with a PDF viewer application such as Adobe Acrobat or Evince, where the borders are less likely to display over text.

## How to build

The paper also comes as a single ``latex`` file ``Paper.tex``, which is built as a PDF as follows.

```
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper.git
cd yellowpaper
